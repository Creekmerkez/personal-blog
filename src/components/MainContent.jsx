            Hi there! I'm a <span className="highlight">Test Automation Engineer</span> with over a decade of experience in IT, but my journey extends beyond technology into the realms of music, writing, and conscious living.
          </p>
          <p className="bio-wide">
            Music has always been a vital part of my life. Through <span className="highlight">DJing</span>, I've created <span className="highlight">17 mixes</span>, each one a unique expression of creativity and emotion. While currently on pause, this passion remains an essential part of who I am.
          </p>
          <p className="bio-wide">
            <span className="highlight">Prague</span> is my home, where I live with my <span className="highlight">wonderful husband and our son</span> who constantly inspires me. Together, we embrace a lifestyle centered on freedom, flexibility, and mindful choices.
          </p>
          <p className="bio-wide">
            Writing <span className="highlight">children's books</span> brings me immense joy. Each story I write aims to spark curiosity and imagination in young minds. My books reflect my belief in the power of storytelling to shape young perspectives.
          </p>
          <p className="bio-wide">
            Living consciously guides my choices - from maintaining a <span className="highlight">meat-free diet</span> to ensuring everything I use aligns with <span className="highlight">cruelty-free</span> values. This commitment reflects my deep respect for all forms of life.
          </p>
          <p className="bio-narrow">
            I also help others create meaningful digital experiences through AI-powered solutions. If you're interested in crafting something unique and beautiful, I'd love to collaborate.
