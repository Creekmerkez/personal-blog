  const bio = `Hi there! I'm a **Test Automation Engineer** with over a decade of experience in IT, but my journey extends beyond technology into the realms of music, writing, and conscious living. 

Music has always been a vital part of my life. Through **DJing**, I've created [**17 mixes**](https://www.youtube.com/@juliamerkusheva), each one a unique expression of creativity and emotion. While currently on pause, this passion remains an essential part of who I am.

**Prague** is my home, where I live with my **wonderful husband and our son** who constantly inspires me. Together, we embrace a lifestyle centered on freedom, flexibility, and mindful choices.

Writing **children's books** brings me immense joy. Each story I write aims to spark curiosity and imagination in young minds. My books reflect my belief in the power of storytelling to shape young perspectives.

Living consciously guides my choices - from maintaining a **meat-free diet** to ensuring everything I use aligns with **cruelty-free** values. This commitment reflects my deep respect for all forms of life.

I also help others create meaningful digital experiences through AI-powered solutions. 
If you're interested in crafting something unique and beautiful, I'd love to collaborate.



P.S.

I'm Ukrainian, and I dream of a free, peaceful Ukraine â€” free from Russian aggression.
